#
# #created a directory called night_writer
#   #created sub-directories for lib, coverate (SimpleCov)
#   #created lib and spec files
#   #created tentative class files for a couple items (spec helper, dictionary)
#   #initialized
# # Because of the *, Ruby knows to assign ARGV[0] to first_arg, and the rest of the arguments to the_rest. Letâ€™s prove it:
